# This is a project I created to showcase my skills with reactjs and the youtube data api.

1. Add The API Key as seen on my resume to the file youtube.config.js in the 
src/config folder

2. Issue the command "npm start" at the root of the repo. The app
will automatically open up on your browser. Make sure no other app is 
running on port 8080.

3. The search bar will automatically update the videos as you type
in a query.
